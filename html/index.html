		<p>The UK government warned yesterday that Russian President Vladimir Putin and his commanders in Ukraine could face prosecution for war crimes and that Western sanctions would remain "for as long as it takes". On a visit to Poland, Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned Putin's "barbaric, indiscriminate" tactics against Ukrainian civilians, after shelling hit one city. The attack on Kharkiv has destroyed a school and, according to its mayor, killed at least 11 civilians.</p>

		<p>Western sanctions against Russia are having a huge impact on its economy, Germany's finance minister said yesterday, as the G7 mulled further punitive measures in response to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.

G7 finance ministers at a meeting "exchanged suggestions for further measures that could be taken", Lindner told a press conference, adding that a decision on the proposals would be taken in the coming days.</p>
